Battleship
--
This is a classic battleship game that developed in Unity with C# as programming language. Aim of this project is to improve my knowledge and ability on Unity, networking and mobile technologies. Game will be developed as an open source project to let other people benefit who wants to learn or improve things related to this project. More information will be added soon along with the development

A rough plan of the development can be found on this Trello board: https://trello.com/b/7HvgfiWf/battleship
